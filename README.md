Building History (buildinghistory.iit.edu)is a digital collection created and curated by the Paul V. Galvin Library at Illinois Institute of Technology. Building History shows Illinois Tech's Mies Campus as it is and as it once was, exploring the ways that the campus and the Bronzeville neighborhood around it have changed (and changed each other) since the Armour Institute opened its doors in 1893.  

This repository contains the theme and plugin files for Building History, including all edits made by Galvin Library staff. It does not include the core Omeka files.
